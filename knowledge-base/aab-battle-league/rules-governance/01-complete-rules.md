## General Principles

### Respect and Sportsmanship

**Rule 1**: Be respectful of other coaches, property and time. We are looking to build something long lasting and fun. While not mandatory, it is encouraged that coaches come up with team names. Please do be respectful when naming your team. If this is something we all enjoy doing there is a potential for coaches to look into streaming or making videos in the future.

**Rule 12**: **All Rules are subject to change at the end of each season and/or prior to the beginning of the following season. Rules can be amended and changed mid season, at the majority ruling of the mods once a vote has taken place. Results will be posted if needed for clarity.**
