## Using in Open WebUI

### RAG Integration

Open WebUI can ingest these markdown files as knowledge base documents. The structured organization enables semantic search and context-aware responses about database alignment.

### Key Topics Covered

- Supabase CLI usage and commands
- Migration system architecture
- Local vs production workflows
- Alignment strategies and procedures
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Recovery procedures
- Advanced diff and automation techniques

### Search Patterns

Users can ask questions like:
- "How do I align my local and production databases?"
- "What's the difference between db pull and db push?"
- "How do I resolve migration conflicts?"
- "What's the best workflow for deploying migrations?"
