## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Shared MCP Configuration

**File**: `lib/agents/mcp-servers.ts`

This module provides:
- Pre-configured MCP server instances
- Helper functions for initialization/cleanup
- Server groupings (all, research-focused, draft-focused)

### Updated Agents

All three agents now use the shared MCP servers:

1. **Draft Assistant** (`lib/agents/draft-assistant.ts`)
   - Uses: Draft Pool + Sequential Thinking
   - Can access: All MCP servers via `getDraftMCPServers()`

2. **Free Agency Agent** (`lib/agents/free-agency-agent.ts`)
   - Uses: All MCP servers
   - Can research Pokémon, analyze trades, extract content

3. **Battle Strategy Agent** (`lib/agents/battle-strategy-agent.ts`)
   - Uses: All MCP servers
   - Can research moves, strategies, extract battle guides

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# MCP Server API Keys (from Notion Credentials database)
BRAVE_API_KEY=BSArD2QB4pyWBoLUP2dxCv2qZkAz79l
TAVILY_API_KEY=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
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-38c356eab8bb481e9c54a0ea7b87217d

# Draft Pool MCP Server (existing)
MCP_DRAFT_POOL_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321/mcp
```

**Note**: The API keys are also hardcoded as fallbacks in `mcp-servers.ts` for development, but environment variables are preferred.

---

## 🐳 Docker Requirements

All stdio-based MCP servers require Docker to be running. The agents will spawn Docker containers for:

- `mcp/sequentialthinking`
- `mcp/brave-search`
- `mcp/tavily`
- `mcp/firecrawl`
- `mcp/fetch`

**Requirements**:
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine running
- Docker socket accessible from Node.js process
- Sufficient permissions to run Docker commands

**Note**: In serverless environments (Vercel), Docker commands may not work. Consider:
- Using HTTP-based MCP servers instead
- Running agents in a containerized environment
- Using a separate service for MCP server management

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Docker Command Execution

The stdio-based MCP servers spawn Docker containers. This means:

1. **Docker must be running** - Agents will fail if Docker is not available
2. **Performance** - Container startup adds latency (~1-2 seconds per server)
3. **Resource usage** - Each agent call may spawn multiple containers
4. **Serverless limitations** - May not work in Vercel/serverless environments

### Error Handling

The implementation includes:
- Try/catch around MCP connections
- Graceful fallback if servers are unavailable
- Warning logs for connection failures
- Agents can still function with partial MCP availability

### Connection Management

- MCP servers are initialized on-demand when agents are used
- Connections are cached and reused when possible
- Cleanup functions properly close all connections

## 🧪 Testing

To test the new MCP tools:

1. **Ensure Docker is running**
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

2. **Test Draft Assistant with research**
   ```typescript
   const result = await getDraftRecommendation({
     teamId: 'your-team-id',
     context: 'Research competitive water type Pokémon and suggest the best pick'
   })
   ```

3. **Test Free Agency Agent with research**
   ```typescript
   const result = await evaluateFreeAgencyTarget({
     teamId: 'your-team-id',
     pokemonName: 'Flutter Mane'
   })
   ```

4. **Test Battle Strategy Agent with research**
   ```typescript
   const result = await suggestBattleMoves(
     'team-1',
     'team-2',
     'Pikachu',
     'Charizard'
   )
   ```
