## **All times below will be in accordance to Eastern Standard Time (EST)**

1. | Be respectful of other coaches, property and time. We are looking to build something long lasting and fun. | Which pokemon to add or remove from draft pool for Season 5. (Pokemon of Ruin, Urshifu's, any box legendaries, Terapagos, Paradox mons [Gouging Fire, Raging Bolt, Flutter Mane])
2. | While not mandatory, it is encouraged that coaches come up with team names. (Please do be respectful when naming your team. If this is something we all enjoy doing there is a potential for coaches to look into streaming or making videos in the future). | Review what happens after a coach (or coaches) drop mid season. (Battles left in the season, how to handle forfeits and kill assignments, do we have mods fill in for the balance of the season [if so, rotation, or set one mod to battle every week], do we look for a fill in from reddit? Do coaches get the option to just not battle? If a coach chooses not to battle, what are the reprecussions of choosing not to battle if there is a fill in coach or a mod to battle in place of the coach that dropped?
3. | Each match must take place the week it is intended. You have from Monday at 12:01AM EST until the following Sunday at 11:59PM EST to complete a match. In the event that one coach is not able to make reasonable efforts or accommodations, that match will result in a forfeit at 12:00AM (midnight EST) on the latter Sunday of the week, before the following weeks matches begin. That is an automatic 0-3 loss for the coach not able to make reasonable accommodations. (Life happens, and we get that. Please do your best to set aside an hour in the week, maybe the same night every week, and have the battle). If there are issues, please reach out to the mods to make us aware of issues. Results will be at the descretion of the mods. It will be brought to a vote amongst the mods and a decision will be made and posted for clarity. | Review Discord's Suggestions channel for any league members suggestions.
4. | In the event both coaches are unable to make reasonable efforts a 0-4 loss will be given to both coaches. Results will be at the descrestion of the mods. It will be brought to a vote amongst the mods and the decision will be posted. | Review Tera Rules, change rules pertaining to changing Tera types or adding/dropping a Tera Captain. Look at Banned Tera Mons, Need updating?
5. | Results to be reported to the Google Docs page by both coaches at the end of the match. Coaches are responsible for recording accurate information. (KO's) | Review Current Banned Movesets and look at unbanning or adding to the banned list. Includes ability
6. | Trash talking is encouraged, but please be mindful of others. Please do not make it personal and be respectful. Don't get out of hand. Remember, this is for fun. | Review "Battle Rules" (Level 50 vs Level 100) Flat Rules vs Unrestricted Rules (Ingame)
7. | Rule changes must be agreed upon and voted with majority ruling amongst the mods. | Limiting Playoff to a 20 minute timer to align more with VGC style tournaments. (Comps can still be used in reg season in this format)
8. | At this time, there are no rules against streaming or making videos if you would like to. Please just give credit where it's due.
9. | If a coach drops at any point throughout the season, they will not be allowed to rejoin the league without a vote from the mods. There are extenuating circumstances that can affect this decision.
