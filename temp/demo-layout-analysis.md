# Demo Next.js with Supabase Layout Analysis

**Reference Site:** https://demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app/

## Observations from Page Snapshot

From the browser snapshot, I can see:
- Clean, centered layout
- Navigation bar at top
- Main content area with proper spacing
- Footer at bottom
- No horizontal scrolling issues

## Key Layout Patterns to Investigate

1. **Container Usage**: How do they handle container max-widths?
2. **Root Layout Structure**: How is the root layout organized?
3. **Overflow Handling**: How do they prevent horizontal overflow?
4. **Responsive Design**: How do they handle mobile vs desktop?

## Next Steps

Need to:
1. Check their GitHub repository for layout code
2. Inspect their CSS/globals.css approach
3. Compare their container patterns to ours
4. See if they use any special overflow handling
